# sms-spam-classification-nlp
An SMS Spam and Ham Classifier project leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project implements feature engineering, text preprocessing, tokenization, vectorization, and pipeline creation for efficient data analysis. The classification is powered by Naive Bayes and includes  visualization, and sparsity calculation.

# SMS Spam Classification with NLP ðŸš€

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive exploration of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham**. By applying various feature engineering and machine learning techniques, the classifier achieves effective results in identifying spam messages.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized key patterns and insights in SMS data.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Implemented tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Vectorization Techniques**: Used **CountVectorizer** and **TF-IDF** for feature extraction.
- **Pipeline Integration**: Combined feature engineering and Naive Bayes algorithm for seamless data processing.
- **Sparsity Calculation**: Measured sparsity in the vectorized text data to optimize performance.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models and pipeline integration
